                        <h1>Securities and Exchange Commission</h1>
                        <p>This past summer I interned with the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis (DERA). My day to day mostly comprised of data engineering tasks including the automation of webscraping for
                            terrabytes worth of stock exchange data. During the second half of my internship, I had the opportunity to assist in economic research with my supervisor based on the 
                            January 2021 marketwide increase in shares traded over the counter (ATS and non ATS).

                        <p>I interned in the section (MPOA) responsible for calculating money supply! I worked to write Python programs used for statistical analysis of
                            financial reports. My largest contribution is a program currently in use that finds outliers in data collections
                            using the jacknife statistical approach. Almost all of my work was related to the disclosure of information required to set the discount rate.

                        <p>I started studying at the University of Maryland in the fall of 2020. While here, I have had the opportunity to work for real clients as part of the QUEST honors consulting program.
                            I have also been able to participate in the Business, Society, and the Economy scholars program as a peer mentor for freshman students.
