                        <p> I'm currently working on a couple of data projects while searching for an internship. I also
                                love to engage in PC building, board games, and volunteer work.

                        <p>During the summer, I worked to write Python programs used for statistical analysis of
                            financial reports. My largest contribution is a program currently in use that finds outliers in data collections
                            using the jacknife statistical approach.

                        <p> Volunteering has been an integral part of my life since highschool where I started volunteering
                            at a variety of local non profits. I received the county certificate of meritorious service for having
                            over 260 hours of volunteer experience.</p>
