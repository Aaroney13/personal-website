                    <h2>Stimmy Socks: Project Description</h2>
                    <p>In this project, my team was tasked with designing a product that met the needs of one of the five senses. The team: <br> conducted interviews, surveyed athletes, designed and prototyped a product, analyzed market and financial considerations, presented findings, and developed a paper.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Problem Identification</h2>
                    <p>We started our project by identifying a problem. This involved interviewing a variety of individuals. I personally interviewed a 4th year medical student who had found issues reguarding PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic. <br>Below are some sample interview notes we took.
                    </p>

                    <p>Ultimately, we decided to focus our product around one person we interviewed, David. David is a quarterback on the University of Maryland football team. He struggled with managing his time between practice and school. This meant that he had to give up access to critical recovery methods like physical therapists.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Product Design</h2>
                    <p>Originally, we designed a product based on a shoe insert. After rounds of feedback however, we rethought and redesigned our product, opting for a sock that uses TENS therapy in order to reduce foot pain. <br> Below are some prototype considerations and a rough sketch.
                    </p>
                    <div class="center">
                        <img src="images/interviewnotes/initialprototyping.PNG" width="auto" height="auto" style="padding:1%;max-width:40%;max-height:40%"alt="Prototyping Notes1">

                    </div>
                    <p>At the top of the sock we use a custom pcb connected to a set of TENS therapy patches at the base of the sock. To prototype this product we 3D printed housing for the electronics shown below.
                    </p>
                    <div class="center">

                    </div>
                    <p>We then stiched velcro to the base and side of the sock in order for the tens unit to be attached. This allows the user to machine wash the sock without destroying the electrical components.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Survey</h2>
                    <p>After designing our product, we refined our specifications by surveying several athletes. We found a clear market for our product as 17/26 of the athletes surveyed are currently using alternative foot recovery methods. </p>

                    <h2>Economic Indicators</h2>
                    <p>This is a sample project of creating models to show the correlation between different key economic health indicators.
                        The following graph shows a model of % changes of GDP predicting % changes of inflation since 1960.
                    </p>

                    <p>As you can tell from the graph above, inflation and gdp have a pretty clear relationship (as nominal GDP is affected by changes of inflation). This cannot be said for the Dow Jones and GDP.
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/DJIandGDP.PNG" alt="inflation and gdp" width="30%" height="20%" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;padding-left:1%;padding-top:1%;animation: fadein 2s;display: block;margin: 0 auto;">
                    <p>If we add in a variety of other variables including: unemployment, consumer confidence, and inflation we see a slightly greater correlation.
                        Most of the movement is still drawn from GDP, showing that there is very little effect of these variables in explaining variation of the DJIA.
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/ALLandDJI.PNG" alt="inflation and gdp" width="30%" height="20%" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;padding-left:1%;padding-top:1%;animation: fadein 2s;display: block;margin: 0 auto;">
                    <p>The primary conclusion of this is that the stock market is related to a large variety of factors and is not
                        an indicator of overall economic health. This project had me thinking, if the stock market isn't really an indicator of overall health, what might it be an indicator of? Economic growth? Eventually I aim to look at individual company stocks and use common metrics to determine what really drives share prices over time.
