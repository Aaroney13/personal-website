                    <p class="frame">In March, I was selected as a data challenge finalist for Meta. This involved an application process with a data case study. After being selected, I had the opportunity to attend Meta workshops and work on a data science pitch for two data scientists. </p>
                    <h2>The task</h2>
                    <p class="frame">I was tasked with analyzing a Netflix dataset to understand what content is successful in Netflix Canada <br> In order to complete this, I felt that I needed to gather more data related to the titles. The ideal dataset, i believed would include the total number of streams for each title. This is not data that is easily available outside of Netflix, so I decided to think of other measures that might work.</p>

                    <p class="frame">In order to grab the dates via webscraping, I used Beautiful Soup to make requests. At first I used Google, however, encountered the error of being denied access. This then led me to using Bing. I also opted to switch my user agent everytime using a repo that I found for grabbing random ones. This led me to successfully scraping all the review numbers and counts for each of the titles in the dataset.</p>

                    <p class="frame">In this project, my team was tasked with designing a product that met the needs of one of the five senses. The team: conducted interviews, surveyed athletes, designed and prototyped a product, analyzed market and financial considerations, presented findings, and developed a paper.

                    <p class="frame">We started our project by identifying a problem. This involved interviewing a variety of individuals. I personally interviewed a 4th year medical student who had found issues reguarding PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic. <br>Below are some sample interview notes we took.

                    <p class="frame">Ultimately, we decided to focus our product around one person we interviewed, David. David is a quarterback on the University of Maryland football team. He struggled with managing his time between practice and school. This meant that he had to give up access to critical recovery methods like physical therapists.
                    </p>
                    <h2 >Product Design</h2>
                    <p class="frame">Originally, we designed a product based on a shoe insert. After rounds of feedback however, we rethought and redesigned our product, opting for a sock that uses TENS therapy in order to reduce foot pain. <br> Below are some prototype considerations and a rough sketch.

                    <p class="frame">At the top of the sock we use a custom pcb connected to a set of TENS therapy patches at the base of the sock. To prototype this product we 3D printed housing for the electronics shown below.

                    <p class="frame">We then stiched velcro to the base and side of the sock in order for the tens unit to be attached. This allows the user to machine wash the sock without destroying the electrical components.

                        The following graph shows a model of % changes of GDP predicting % changes of inflation since 1960.

                    <p class="frame">As you can tell from the graph above, inflation and gdp have a pretty clear relationship (as nominal GDP is affected by changes of inflation). This cannot be said for the Dow Jones and GDP.

                    <p class="frame">If we add in a variety of other variables including: unemployment, consumer confidence, and inflation we see a slightly greater correlation.
                        Most of the movement is still drawn from GDP, showing that there is very little effect of these variables in explaining variation of the DJIA.

                        an indicator of overall economic health. This project had me thinking, if the stock market isn't really an indicator of overall health, what might it be an indicator of? Economic growth? Eventually I aim to look at individual company stocks and use common metrics to determine what really drives share prices over time.
