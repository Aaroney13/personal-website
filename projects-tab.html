                    <h2>Meta Data Challenge</h2>
                    <p>
                        In March, I was chosen as one of 86 undergraduate students in North America selected for a competitive five-month data science apprenticeship involving small and large group projects, one-on-one mentorship opportunities, peer networking and technical workshops.
                    </p>
                    <p>During this time I had one project where I was tasked with analyzing a Netflix dataset to understand what content is successful in Netflix Canada. In order to complete this, I felt that I needed to gather more data related to the titles. The ideal dataset, I believed would include the total number of streams for each title. This is not data that is easily available outside of Netflix, 
                        so I decided to think of other measures that might work.</p>
                    <div class="center">
                        <img src="images/imdb page.PNG" width="auto" height="auto" style="padding:1%;max-width:60vw;min-width:400px;"alt="IMDB page of squid game">
                    </div>
                    <p>I decided to use the number above, the number of IMDB reviews that are posted to the website. In order to get this data, however, I would need to web scrape for it. I used beautiful soup and requests to gather the information on all of the imdb ratings for matching titles on Netflix.
                        I then downloaded this to a csv so that I could use it in my observations.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Visualized data</h2>
                    <p> After aggregating the data, I used Matplotlib to generate insights around Netflix titles in Canada. I found a variety of insights around what types of content is successful. One example is that movies with the tags sci-fi and thriller have far higher median number of
                        review counts on IMDB vs other titles. I used this data to then plot the review score /8 on IMDB vs the review counts for the sample titles. Below is an example graph with the x axis being rating value, and y being number of ratings on IMDB. </p>

                    <h2>Rokoske</h2>
                    <p >In this project, I worked in a team to discover the rotation period for asteroid 3736 Rokoske. This involved measuring the light seen from the asteroid over the course of several nights of observation.
                        Our paper is currently awaiting publication in a scientific journal.</p>
                    <h2>Process</h2>
                    <p>On several nights, I observed Rokoske using the T21 telescope in Mayhill, New Mexico. Below is an example finder image for the night of April 1st that was used to ensure the telescope aligned with the needed
                        positioning. The background of this page is also an image taken during observation.</p>
                    <div class="img_center">

                    </div>
                    <p>During each night of observation, we would take pictures of the asteroid in sets of 5 with 300 seconds of exposure. We also would keep logs of all the telescopic movements and atmospheric conditions. On several nights,
                        weather kept our telescope from being able to take images of the asteroid, leaving us with less data to work with.
                    </p>
                    <div class="img_center">

                    </div>
                    <p>After our team finished the observationary period, we worked to identify the rotation period over several weeks using MPO canopus. This began with creating a lightcurve for each night of observation. Below
                        is an example of a lightcurve generated for the night of April 10th. This is created by calculating the relative magnitude of the asteroid from each usable image taken during the night.

                    </div>
                    <p>Once all nightly lightcurves were created, our team worked to compile a phased lightcurve which used generated fourier series to try and estimate a lightcurve for the whole rotation period. Our groups conclusion
                        is that the rotation period for Rokoske is 17.42 hours.

                    <h2>Stimmy Socks</h2>
                    <p>In this project, my team was tasked with designing a product that met the needs of one of the five senses. The team: conducted interviews, surveyed athletes, designed and prototyped a product, analyzed market and financial considerations, presented findings, and developed a paper.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Problem Identification</h2>
                    <p>We started our project by identifying a problem. This involved interviewing a variety of individuals. I personally interviewed a 4th year medical student who had found issues reguarding PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic. <br>Below are some sample interview notes we took.

                    <p>Ultimately, we decided to focus our product around one person we interviewed, David. David is a quarterback on the University of Maryland football team. He struggled with managing his time between practice and school. This meant that he had to give up access to critical recovery methods like physical therapists.

                    <h2 >Product Design</h2>
                    <p>Originally, we designed a product based on a shoe insert. After rounds of feedback however, we rethought and redesigned our product, opting for a sock that uses TENS therapy in order to reduce foot pain. <br> Below are some prototype considerations and a rough sketch.
                    </p>
                    <div class="img_center">

                    </div>
                    <p>At the top of the sock we use a custom pcb connected to a set of TENS therapy patches at the base of the sock. To prototype this product we 3D printed housing for the electronics shown below.

                    </div>
                    <p>We then stiched velcro to the base and side of the sock in order for the tens unit to be attached. This allows the user to machine wash the sock without destroying the electrical components.
                    </p>
